# Stylized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This personal project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline tailored for **text style transfer**. The goal is to augment the generation process with relevant retrieved content while adapting the output to a specific writing style.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

Build an intelligent pipeline that:
- Retrieves relevant documents based on user input.
- Uses these documents to guide text generation.
- Applies a **style transfer** mechanism to convert the generated output into a desired tone or literary style.

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- **RAG Architecture**: Combines retrieval and generation for improved contextual relevance.
- **Style Transfer**: Adjusts the tone and writing style of the generated output to fit a chosen literary or stylistic domain.
- **Modular Implementation**: Easy to plug in different retrievers, models, and style transfer techniques.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Hugging Face Transformers
- FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
- SentenceTransformers / SBERT
- Language Models (e.g., GPT, BART, etc.)

## ðŸ§ª Pipeline Overview

1. **Text Embedding & Indexing**: Input documents are encoded and indexed for fast retrieval.
2. **Query Handling**: User input is embedded and matched against the indexed data.
3. **Retrieval Step**: Top-k relevant documents are fetched.
4. **Stylized Generation**: Retrieved context is passed to a language model that outputs a stylized response.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone this repo and install the required libraries.
2. Prepare a dataset of source texts for retrieval.
3. Customize the generation and style transfer settings in the notebook.
4. Run the pipeline and enjoy stylized, context-aware outputs.

## ðŸ’¡ Future Improvements

- Support for multiple style presets (e.g., academic, casual, poetic)
- Fine-tuning on specific styles
- Interactive web demo with Gradio or Streamlit
